# Building-a-Data-Mining-System-From-Data-Cleaning-to-Model-Evaluation
In this project I planned and written code for a data mining project, implementing the full CRISP-DM cycle. Implemented a variant for performing the Model training and cross validation process.
To begin, here are the steps you can follow to implement the full CRISP-DM cycle for your data mining project:

Business Understanding: Define the problem you are trying to solve, the goals you hope to achieve, and the stakeholders involved in the project.

Data Understanding: Collect and explore the data you will be working with, identifying any data quality issues, missing values, or other anomalies that may affect your analysis.

Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis, including feature selection, data transformation, and normalization.

Modeling: Develop models that can predict the variables of interest based on the available data.

Evaluation: Validate the models and compare their performance against a set of evaluation measures.

Deployment: Develop recommendations and final reports for stakeholders, and deploy the models and data to production environments.
